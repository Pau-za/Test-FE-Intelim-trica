## App Flux

I realized the flux of what the interface must show, and this is the result:

![flux-app-img]()


## Planning

- I made a kan-ban planning including all the biggest tasks, and thought about the small ones I would have to accomplish to complete the first ones. 
- I ordered the tasks according to the value each one can give to the user. 
- I also wrote the definition of done for each task.

All the planning of my project is available in the projects seccion of this repository.
